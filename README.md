TODO: 

- Understanding how to implement singleton pattern (model should be init once only)
- Understanding how to develop db structure strategy (embeddings + schemas)
- Understanding RAG to complex RAG need (Why we need it and etc...)

- Add intent detection ot RAG
- Add github-actions for quality, security, etc...

As the complexity increase in the system we will have more control over data which will allow use to execute more comples queries with complex RAG. Let's see where this takes us.

If structure looks complex, we can review it later.
